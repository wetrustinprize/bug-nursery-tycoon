Is our attempt on the [Ludum Dare 54](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/$375339/welcome-to-ludum-dare-54) game jam,
the game was made in 72 hours. The game jam theme was: **Limited Space**.

This is our first jam and was nice to see how much we could do in 72 hours, we had a lot of fun and learned a lot.

## The Game

You're a Bug Caretaker and need to handle a lot of creatures in three terrariums, but these creatures have their own
needs and you need to take care of them.

* Creatures can only live in certain biomes and temperatures.
* Some creatures like to be alone.
* Some creatures **hate** being with other species.
* Carnivores will eat other creatures that are not carnivores.
